# Introduction to Python for Data Science :)
 
Python as a Calculator

Python is perfectly suited to do basic calculations. Apart from addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, there is also support for more advanced operations such as exponentiation and modulo. The code in the script on the right gives some examples.

print(5 + 5)      # Addition

print(5 - 5)      # Subtraction

print(3 * 5)      # Multiplication

print(10 / 2)     # Division

print(4 ** 2)     # Exponentiation

Variable Assignment

In Python, a variable allows you to refer to a value with a name. Remember, = in Python means assignment, it doesn‚Äôt test equality!. To create a variable use =, like this example:

## Create a variable savings
savings = 100
## Print out savings
print(savings)
## Create a variable factor
factor = 1.10
## Calculate result
result = savings * (factor**7)
## Print out result 
print(result)

Other Variable Types

In the previous example, you worked with two Python data types:

int, or integer: a number without a fractional part. e.g. 100.

float, or floating point: a number that has both an integer and fractional part, separated by a point. e.g. 10.1.

Next to numerical data types, there are two other very common data types:

str, or string: a type to represent text. You can use single or double quotes to build a string.
bool, or boolean: a type to represent logical values. Can only be True or False (the capitalization is important!).
## Create a variable desc
desc = "compound interest"
## Create a variable profitable
profitable = True

Operations with Other Types

Different types behave differently in Python. When you sum two strings, you‚Äôll get different behavior than when you sum two integers or two booleans. In the script some variables with different types have already been created. It‚Äôs up to you to use them.

savings = 100

factor = 1.1

desc = "compound interest"
## Assign product of factor and savings to year1
year1 = savings * factor
## Print the type of year1
print(type(year1))
## Assign sum of desc and desc to doubledesc
doubledesc = desc + desc
## Print out doubledesc
print(doubledesc)

Type Conversion

Using the + operator to paste together two strings can be very useful in building custom messages. Suppose, for example, that you‚Äôve calculated the return of your investment and want to summarize the results in a string.

print(‚ÄúI started with $‚Äù + savings + ‚Äú and now have $‚Äù + result + ‚Äú. Awesome!‚Äù)

This will not work, though, as you cannot simply sum strings and floats. To fix the error, you‚Äôll need to explicitly convert the types of your variables. More specifically, you‚Äôll need str(), to convert a value into a string. Similar functions such as int(), float() and bool() will help you convert Python values into any type.

## Definition of savings and result
savings = 100

result = 100 * 1.10 ** 7
## Fix the printout
print("I started with $" + str(savings) + " and now have $" + str(result) + ". Awesome!")
## Definition of pi_string
pi_string = "3.1415926"
## Convert pi_string into float: pi_float
pi_float = float(pi_string)

Create a list

As opposed to int, bool etc., a list is a compound data type. After measuring the height of your family, you decide to collect some information on the house you‚Äôre living in. The areas of the different parts of your house are stored in separate variables for now, as shown in the script.

## area variables (in square meters)
hall = 11.25

kit = 18.0

liv = 20.0

bed = 10.75

bath = 9.50
## Create list areas
areas= [hall, kit, liv, bed, bath]

print(areas)

Create List with Different Types

A list can contain any Python type. Although it‚Äôs not really common, a list can also contain a mix of Python types including strings, floats, booleans, etc. The printout of the previous exercise wasn‚Äôt really satisfying. It‚Äôs just a list of numbers representing the areas, but you can‚Äôt tell which area corresponds to which part of your house.

The code below is the start of a solution. For some of the areas, the name of the corresponding room is already placed in front. Pay attention here! ‚Äúbathroom‚Äù is a string, while bath is a variable that represents the float 9.50 you specified earlier.

## area variables (in square meters)
hall = 11.25

kit = 18.0

liv = 20.0

bed = 10.75
bath = 9.50
## Adapt list areas
areas = ["hallway", hall, "kitchen", kit, "living room", liv, "bedroom", bed, "bathroom", bath]

print(areas)

List of Lists

As a data scientist, you‚Äôll often be dealing with a lot of data, and it will make sense to group some of this data. Instead of creating a flat list containing strings and floats, representing the names and areas of the rooms in your house, you can create a list of lists. The script below can already give you an idea. Don‚Äôt get confused here: ‚Äúhallway‚Äù is a string, while hall is a variable that represents the float 11.25 you specified earlier.

## area variables (in square meters)
hall = 11.25

kit = 18.0

liv = 20.0

bed = 10.75

bath = 9.50
## house information as list of lists
house = [["hallway", hall],
         ["kitchen", kit],
         ["living room", liv],
         ["bedroom",bed],
         ["bathroom", bath]]
## Print out house
print(house)
## Print out the type of house
print(type(house))

Subset and Conquer

Subsetting Python lists is a piece of cake. Take the code sample below, which creates a list x and then selects ‚Äúb‚Äù from it. Remember that this is the second element, so it has 
index 1. You can also use negative indexing.

x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]

x[1]

x[-3] # same result!

Remember the areas list from before, containing both strings and floats? Its definition is already in the script. Can you add the correct code to do some Python subsetting?
 
## Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]
## Print out second element from areas
print(areas[1])
## Print out last element from areas
print(areas[-1])
## Print out the area of the living room
print(areas[5])

Subset and Calculate

After you‚Äôve extracted values from a list, you can use them to perform additional calculations. Take this example, where the second and fourth element of a list x are extracted. The strings that result are pasted together using the + operator:

x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]

print(x[1] + x[3])
## Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]
## Sum of kitchen and bedroom area: eat_sleep_area
eat_sleep_area = areas[3]+areas[7]
## Print the variable eat_sleep_area
print(eat_sleep_area)

Slicing and Dicing

Selecting single values from a list is just one part of the story. It‚Äôs also possible to slice your list, which means selecting multiple elements from your list. Use the following syntax:

my_list[start:end]

my_list[including, excluding]

## Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]
## Use slicing to create downstairs
downstairs=areas[0:6]
## Use slicing to create upstairs
upstairs= areas[-4:]
## Print out downstairs and upstairs
print(downstairs)

print(upstairs)

It‚Äôs also possible not to specify these indexes. If you don‚Äôt specify the begin index, Python figures out that you want to start your slice at the beginning of your list. If you don‚Äôt specify the end index, the slice will go all the way to the last element of your list.

## Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]
## Alternative slicing to create downstairs
downstairs=areas[:6]
## Alternative slicing to create upstairs
upstairs=areas[-4:]

Replace list elements

Replacing list elements is pretty easy. Simply subset the list and assign new values to the subset. You can select single elements or you can change entire list slices at once.

## Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]
## Correct the bathroom area
areas[9]= 10.50
## Change "living room" to "chill zone"
areas[4]= "chill zone"

Extend a list

If you can change elements in a list, you sure want to be able to add elements to it, right? You can use the + operator:

## Create the areas list and make some changes
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "chill zone", 20.0,
         "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 10.50]
## Add poolhouse data to areas, new list is areas_1
areas_1= areas+ ["poolhouse", 24.5]
## Add garage data to areas_1, new list is areas_2
areas_2 = areas_1 + ["garage",15.45]

Inner workings of lists

The Python code in the script already creates a list with the name areas and a copy named areas_copy. Next, the first element in the areas_copy list is changed and the areas list is printed out. If you hit Run Code you‚Äôll see that, although you‚Äôve changed areas_copy, the change also takes effect in the areas list. That‚Äôs because areas and areas_copy point to the same list. If you want to prevent changes in areas_copy from also taking effect in areas, you‚Äôll have to do a more explicit copy of the areas list. You can do this with list() or by using [:].

## Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]
## Create areas_copy
areas_copy = list(areas)
## Change areas_copy
areas_copy[0] = 5.0
## Print areas
print(areas)

Familiar functions

Out of the box, Python offers a bunch of built-in functions to make your life as a data scientist easier. You already know two such functions: print() and type(). You‚Äôve also used the functions str(), int(), bool() and float() to switch between data types. These are built-in functions as well.

Calling a function is easy. To get the type of 3.0 and store the output as a new variable, result, you can use the following:

## Create variables var1 and var2
var1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]

var2 = True
## Print out type of var1
print(type(var1))
## Print out length of var1
print(len(var1))
## Convert var2 to an integer: out2
out2 = int(var2)

Multiple arguments

In the previous exercise, the square brackets around imag in the documentation showed us that the imag argument is optional. But Python also uses a different way to tell users about arguments being optional. Have a look at the documentation of sorted() by typing help(sorted) in the IPython Shell. You‚Äôll see that sorted() takes three arguments: iterable, key and reverse.

key=None means that if you don‚Äôt specify the key argument, it will be None. reverse=False means that if you don‚Äôt specify the reverse argument, it will be False.

In this exercise, you‚Äôll only have to specify iterable and reverse, not key. The first input you pass to sorted() will be matched to the iterable argument, but what about the second input? To tell Python you want to specify reverse without changing anything about key, you can use =:

sorted( __ , reverse = __ )

Note: For now, we can understand an iterable as being any collection of objects, e.g. a List.

## Create lists first and second
first = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0]

second = [10.75, 9.50]
## Paste together first and second: full
full = first + second
## Sort full in descending order: full_sorted
full_sorted = sorted(full, reverse= True)
## Print out full_sorted
print(full_sorted)

String Methods

Strings come with a bunch of methods. If you want to discover them in more detail, you can always type help(str) in the IPython Shell. A string place has already been created for you to experiment with.

## string to experiment with: room
room = "poolhouse"
## Use upper() on room: room_up
room_up= room.upper()
## Print out room and room_up
print(room)

print(room_up)
## Print out the number of o's in room
print(room.count("o"))

List Methods

Strings are not the only Python types that have methods associated with them. Lists, floats, integers and booleans are also types that come packaged with a bunch of useful methods.

index(), to get the index of the first element of a list that matches its input and count(), to get the number of times an element appears in a list.

## Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]
## Print out the index of the element 20.0
print(areas.index(20.0))
## Print out how often 14.5 appears in areas
print(areas.count(14.5))

Most list methods will change the list they‚Äôre called on. Examples are:

append(), that adds an element to the list it is called on, remove(), that removes the first element of a list that matches the input, and reverse(), that reverses the order of the elements in the list it is called on.

## Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]
## Use append twice to add poolhouse and garage size
areas.append(24.5)

areas.append(15.45)
## Print out areas
print(areas)
## Reverse the orders of the elements in areas
areas.reverse()
## Print out areas
print(areas)

Import package

As a data scientist, some notions of geometry never hurt. Let‚Äôs refresh some of the basics.
For a fancy clustering algorithm, you want to find the circumference, C, and area, A, of a circle. When the radius of the circle is r, you can calculate C and A as:

C=2œÄr A=œÄr2

To use the constant pi, you‚Äôll need the math package.

## Definition of radius
r = 0.43
## Import the math package
import math
## Selective import
from math import pi
## Calculate C
C = 2 * math.pi * r
## Calculate A
A = math.pi * r * r
## Build printout
print("Circumference: " + str(C))

print("Area: " + str(A))

Your First NumPy Array

We‚Äôre going to dive into the world of baseball. Along the way, you‚Äôll get comfortable with the basics of numpy, a powerful package to do data science.

## Create list baseball
baseball = [180, 215, 210, 210, 188, 176, 209, 200]
## Import the numpy package as np
import numpy as np
## Create a Numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball= np.array(baseball)
## Print out type of np_baseball
print(type(np_baseball))

You are a huge baseball fan. You decide to call the MLB (Major League Baseball) and ask around for some more statistics on the height of the main players. They pass along data on more than a thousand players, which is stored as a regular Python list: height. The height is expressed in inches. Source

## Import numpy
import numpy as np
## Create a Numpy array from height: np_height
np_height= np.array(height)
## Print out np_height
print(np_height)
## Convert np_height to m: np_height_m
np_height_m = np_height * 0.0254
## Print np_height_m
print(np_height_m)

The MLB also offers to let you analyze their weight data. Again, both are available as regular Python lists: height and weight. height is in inches and weight is in pounds. It‚Äôs now possible to calculate the BMI of each baseball player.

## height and weight are available as a regular lists
## Import numpy
import numpy as np
## Create array from height with correct units: np_height_m
np_height_m = np.array(height) * 0.0254
## Create array from weight with correct units: np_weight_kg
np_weight_kg= np.array(weight) * 0.453592
## Calculate the BMI: bmi
bmi = np_weight_kg / np_height_m ** 2
## Print out bmi
print(bmi)

To subset both regular Python lists and numpy arrays, you can use square brackets:

## height and weight are available as a regular lists
## Import numpy
import numpy as np
## Calculate the BMI: bmi
np_height_m = np.array(height) * 0.0254

np_weight_kg = np.array(weight) * 0.453592

bmi = np_weight_kg / np_height_m ** 2
## Create the light array
light = bmi<21
## Print out light
print(light)
## Print out BMIs of all baseball players whose BMI is below 21
print(bmi[light])

Subsetting NumPy Arrays

You‚Äôve seen it with your own eyes: Python lists and numpy arrays sometimes behave differently. Luckily, there are still certainties in this world. For example, subsetting (using the square bracket notation on lists or arrays) works exactly the same.

## height and weight are available as a regular lists
## Import numpy
import numpy as np
## Store weight and height lists as numpy arrays
np_weight = np.array(weight)

np_height = np.array(height)
## Print out the weight at index 50
print(np_weight[50])
## Print out sub-array of np_height: index 100 up to and including index 110
print(np_height[100:111])

Your First 2D NumPy Array

Before working on the actual MLB data, let‚Äôs try to create a 2D numpy array from a small list of lists. Here baseball is a list of lists. The main list contains 4 elements. Each of these elements is a list containing the height and the weight of 4 baseball players, in this order.

## Create baseball, a list of lists
baseball = [[180, 78.4],
            [215, 102.7],
            [210, 98.5],
            [188, 75.2]]
## Import numpy
import numpy as np
## Create a 2D Numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball= np.array(baseball)
## Print out the type of np_baseball
print(type(np_baseball))
## Print out the shape of np_baseball

print(np_baseball.shape)

You have another look at the MLB data and realize that it makes more sense to restructure all this information in a 2D numpy array. This array should have 1015 rows, corresponding to the 1015 baseball players you have information on, and 2 columns (for height and weight). The MLB was, again, very helpful and passed you the data in a different structure, a Python list of lists. In this list of lists, each sublist represents the height and weight of a single baseball player. The name of this embedded list is baseball.

## baseball is available as a regular list of lists
## Import numpy package
import numpy as np
## Create a 2D Numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball= np.array(baseball)
## Print out the shape of np_baseball
print(np_baseball.shape)

Subsetting 2D NumPy Arrays

If your 2D numpy array has a regular structure, i.e. each row and column has a fixed number of values, complicated ways of subsetting become very easy. Have a look at the code below where the elements ‚Äúa‚Äù and ‚Äúc‚Äù are extracted from a list of lists.

## regular list of lists
x = [["a", "b"], ["c", "d"]]

[x[0][0], x[1][0]]

## baseball is available as a regular list of lists
## Import numpy package
import numpy as np
## Create np_baseball (2 cols)
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)
## Print out the 50th row of np_baseball
print(np_baseball[49,:])
## Select the entire second column of np_baseball: np_weight
np_weight = np_baseball[:,1]
## Print out height of 124th player
print(np_baseball[123,0])

2D Arithmetic

Remember how you calculated the Body Mass Index for all baseball players? numpy was able to perform all calculations element-wise (i.e. element by element). For 2D numpy arrays this isn‚Äôt any different! You can combine matrices with single numbers, with vectors, and with other matrices.

## baseball is available as a regular list of lists
## update is available as 2D Numpy array
## Import numpy package
import numpy as np
## Create np_baseball (3 cols)
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)
## Print out addition of np_baseball and update
print(np_baseball+update)
## Create Numpy array: conversion
conversion = np.array([0.0254,0.453592,1])
## Print out product of np_baseball and conversion
print(np_baseball*conversion)

Average versus Median

You now know how to use numpy functions to get a better feeling for your data. It basically comes down to importing numpy and then calling several simple functions on the numpy arrays. The baseball data is available as a 2D numpy array with 3 columns (height, weight, age) and 1015 rows. The name of this numpy array is np_baseball. After restructuring the data, however, you notice that some height values are abnormally high. Follow the instructions and discover which summary statistic is best suited if you‚Äôre dealing with so-called outliers.

## np_baseball is available
## Import numpy
import numpy as np
## Create np_height from np_baseball
np_height= np_baseball[:,0]
## Print out the mean of np_height
print(np.mean(np_height))
## Print out the median of np_height
print(np.median(np_height))

Explore the baseball data

Because the mean and median are so far apart, you decide to complain to the MLB. They find the error and send the corrected data over to you. It‚Äôs again available as a 2D Numpy array np_baseball, with three columns. The Python script on the right already includes code to print out informative messages with the different summary statistics.

## np_baseball is available
## Import numpy
import numpy as np
## Print mean height (first column)
avg = np.mean(np_baseball[:,0])

print("Average: " + str(avg))
## Print median height. Replace 'None'
med = np.median(np_baseball[:,0])

print("Median: " + str(med))
## Print out the standard deviation on height. Replace 'None'
stddev = np.std(np_baseball[:,0])

print("Standard Deviation: " + str(stddev))
## Print out correlation between first and second column. Replace 'None'
corr = np.corrcoef(np_baseball[:,0],np_baseball[:,1])

print("Correlation: " + str(corr))

Blend it all together

In the last few exercises we‚Äôve learned everything there is to know about heights and weights of baseball players. Now it‚Äôs time to dive into another sport: soccer.

You‚Äôve contacted FIFA for some data and they handed you two lists. The lists are the following:

positions = ['GK', 'M', 'A', 'D', ...]

heights = [191, 184, 185, 180, ...]

Each element in the lists corresponds to a player. The first list, positions, contains strings representing each player‚Äôs position. The possible positions are: ‚ÄòGK‚Äô (goalkeeper), ‚ÄòM‚Äô (midfield), ‚ÄòA‚Äô (attack) and ‚ÄòD‚Äô (defense). The second list, heights, contains integers representing the height of the player in cm. The first player in the lists is a goalkeeper and is pretty tall (191 cm).

## heights and positions are available as lists
## Import numpy
import numpy as np
## Convert positions and heights to numpy arrays: np_positions, np_heights
np_heights= np.array(heights)
np_positions= np.array(positions)
## Heights of the goalkeepers: gk_heights
gk_heights= np_heights[np_positions == 'GK']
## Heights of the other players: other_heights
other_heights= np_heights[np_positions != 'GK']
## Print out the median height of goalkeepers. Replace 'None'
print("Median height of goalkeepers: " + str(np.median(gk_heights)))
## Print out the median height of other players. Replace 'None'
print("Median height of other players: " + str(np.median(other_heights)))
